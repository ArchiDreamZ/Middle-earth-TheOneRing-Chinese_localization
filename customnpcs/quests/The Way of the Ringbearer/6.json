Boromir has fallen and with him one of the greatest rulers of Middle-earth.
But time to mourn will come!
Now the journey to Mordor continues..
Cracked rocky regions and dead swamps await me next.

I don't know if it's because of the area.. but I feel followed and watched!
I should be careful and head east next towards Amon Lhaw, where I can set up a night camp.",
