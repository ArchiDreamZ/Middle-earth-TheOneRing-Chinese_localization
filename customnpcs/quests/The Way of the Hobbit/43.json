It was evil and very powerful.
Luckily I was able to get rid of it, but only for a short time.

This evil must be banished with something stronger than swords.

It can only have been him,..Sauron.. he must be the necromancer.
I must report this to Radagast.

Lets get away from this place before he comes back.",
