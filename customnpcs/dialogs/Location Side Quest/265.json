But i can feel it.You have to help me with a special mission to conquer the staffs of the two blue wizards. They got stolen by Orcs.I don't know what they need them for, because they are not smart enough to use them. But I'm affrait that they will bring them to someone who is, and can use the power against us. Where the blue wizards are you may ask? Well, that does no one really know. They are Istari like Gandalf and Saruman. The last known location of them was in Harlindon and Ost-In-Edhil. But the staffs could be anywhere right know. Maybe we are lucky and can find them there. Go to the Eagle Eyrie in the east and take an Eagle to the locations. I will meet you there. Once you have both staffs, bring them to me here in Rivendell. Thank you @p! See you soon!",
