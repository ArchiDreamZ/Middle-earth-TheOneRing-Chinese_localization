In those that really mattered!
It were full of darkness and danger.
Sometimes you don't even want to know the ending.
How could such a story have a good ending!

How could the world go back to how it was before when so much bad happened?

But in the end it will passes, this shadow. Even the darkness must go way and
a new day will come and when the sun shines, it will shine even brighter!

Those were the stories that stuck in your mind, even when you were too young to understand them.
But I think.. I get it now.. I know now..

The people in these stories always had the option to turn back, but they didn't.
They kept going because they believed in something..
There is something good in this world and it is worth fighting for!",
