greets you! Nice to see such a friendly face.

This grim man Denethor is saddening me, and I am greatly homesick for the Shire...
Have you seen Merry? He should still be in Edoras, we had to leave quickly and couldn't really say goodbye.

I hope this is just a ceremonial position right?
I really don't want to fight. But it is my duty... After all, Boromir saved us... He was a true hero.

I've gotten very hungry from the long ride with Gandalf. I think it's time for the second breakfast! Farewell @p.

When this is all over, see you for a drink at the Green Dragon.
The best tavern in the Shire!.. oh.. the Shire...

(Pippin begins to sing) Home is behind the world ahead
And there are many paths to tread
Through shadow to the edge of night
Until the stars are all alight.

Mist and shadow
Cloud and shade
All shall fade,
All shall fade.",
