The forest!! He's cursed!
It can't be that all animals get sick at the same time, that's bordering on witchcraft..
Wait... witchcraft... That's it. I knew it.

I know you are on an important mission.
Perhaps the Wood Elves of Green Forest can help you.
Thranduil isn't the most helpful of rulers, but his elf archers could prove useful against the spiders of the forest.

If you still have some time, could you help me with a matter.
Ride to Dol-Guldur, the old forest fortress, and see what's going on there.
I sense that something isn't quite right there.
And feared that the magic has its origin there.
It's dangerous though, maybe we should wait for Gandalf.",
