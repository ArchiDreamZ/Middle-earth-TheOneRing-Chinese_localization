Erebor, the home of the king under the mountain, to behold the halls of stone again pleases me and makes me proud!
We just have to find a way in.. smashing the stones won't do anything.

I fear bad things, the curse of gold is beginning to affect Thorin too..
He was already darkening his grandfather's mind. I don't think it would help if he got the Arkenstone back.

We dwarves are loyal people and stand by our word.. that Thorin broke it to the men and elves shocks me to the core. 

We promised them a share and now he claims he won't share the gold.

This place is not good for him. At least not as long as Smaug is poisoning the gold with his presence.
Take care of yourselves @p !",
