The guards didn't notice anything.

You should wash yourselves, you look terrible.
And then the stench. But better than ending up in the city dungeon.
Now look for the mayor, I was against it, but some of your friends are trying to convince him to help you on your journey.
This greedy guy won't change his mind. He's the worst mayor our town has ever had. He and his henchman Alfred have been oppressing these people for too long.

I wish you all the best in your mission.
And take care of yourselves!",
