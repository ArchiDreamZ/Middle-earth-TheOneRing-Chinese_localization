We stayed here to take care of Kili, he is not fully fit after his injury.

Don't mind about my brother Bifur talking weird stuff, he got an ax stuck in his stubborn skull fighting the orcs and since we weren't sure how to get it out we just left it in. 

He's been talking nonsense ever since, but he's still as brave dwarf and fights as strong as he used to be, 

and the ill of revenge against the orcs is stronger than ever.

Soon we will see the halls of our fathers again! I can barely wait for it, we are so close!",
