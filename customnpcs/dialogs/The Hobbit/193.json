My name is Gloin and I fought with Thorin in the war against Azog's orc armies at the gates of Moria.
He is the leader of our expedition.. it looks as if he has gone, he could hardly stand it here with the elves.. 

He has a great anger against them because they failed to help us at the time.

Oin is my brother and is coming with us. I had to leave my beloved wife and little son Gimli at home, I hope they are well.

Talk to the wizard, he knows how to do it.

Soon we will reconquer Erebor!!",
