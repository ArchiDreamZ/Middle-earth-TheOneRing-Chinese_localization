But they were all betrayed. The dark ruler Sauron forged another ring in the land of Mordor where the shadows loom.

By the time of the Second Age a great alliance of Elves and Men went to war against him and defeated him, or so we thought.
Isildur son of King Elendil of the house of Numenor cut the ring off of Sauron's finger, but did not destroy it. He saw it as a weapon he could use, but the One Ring obeys only the will of the One.

He betrayed him and was hidden for a long time until found by the creature Gollum.
The ring poisoned his mind for many years until finally Bilbo found it.

The dark ruler has bound all his power to the ring and now depends on it.
If he gets it back, we're all doomed.",
