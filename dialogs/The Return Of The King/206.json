Oh... Hello @p
This old wizard and the kid here are telling me something about the end of the world.
As if there wasn't enough bad news at the moment..

Do you see this broken horn in my hand?
My beloved son Boromir passed away recently..
it was his... and now I have only that useless Faramir in Osgiliath...

Tradition says that the ancient kings were burned in the crypt behind the citadel.
Some also alive. Probably the greatest honor of a king at the end of his time.

The seven wall rings of Minas Tirith have never been conquered.
And they won't now either. Go now!

I got hungry and I want the hobbit to sing me a song.
The Lordship of Gondor is MINE! And no one else!!",
