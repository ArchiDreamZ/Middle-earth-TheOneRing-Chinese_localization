Anyway.. I have more important things to do right now.

A great battle lies ahead if this stubborn dwarf doesn't comes to his senses.
The elves have come to give the people of river town help and to support them in forwarding their share.
I admit our venture is not entirely out of charity.

In this mountain are gems that I also desire. Mithril, the heart of our people.
I intend to claim a portion of the mountain's treasure when this is all over.
After all, so much gold has to be shared. The dwarves can never spend this alone!
At least this human Bard agrees with me.

Only this constantly worried wizard bothers me.
He worries too much. He speaks of the forces of evil.
My elven warriors can handle a few orcs.",
